# flair
Fanciful add-ons for WP.

Let's aim for 15 pieces of flair.

## Blocks
- accordion 
- cards [in progress]
- eyebrow
- fixie
- sidebar / inset / boxout
- sidler
- milestone (timeline)
- adds left and right alignment options on the group block... possibly obviating need for sidebar

## Classes
- .flairousel converts WP Columns Block into a carousel. Add class flairousel to make it happen.  Also add class double or triple to make two or three cols visible at a time.
- .slant rotates an element 5Â°
- .iconic paired with .map, .phone, .info, or .email adds a background image and tacks on a little padding-left.
- .wobble [in progress]
- .spotlight [in progress]
- .arrow-left [in progress]
- .arrow-right [in progress]
